                    <p><i>The following extract is from a novel that imagines life in the future. Automation and mechanisation have virtually eliminated the need for human labourers. Society is split into two classes: a wealthy upper class of engineers and technicians, and a lower class of people whose jobs have been replaced by machines. 
                    </i></p><p><i>Doctor Paul Proteus is a high-ranking engineer and factory manager. Paul has found himself in a bar, where an ex-factory worker has struck up a conversation with him
                    </i></p>
                    <p>The man turned to Paul with the friendliest of smiles and said, &lsquo;My boy&rsquo;s just turned eighteen, Doctor,&rsquo;</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nice.&rsquo;</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got his whole life ahead of him. Wonderful age, eighteen.&rsquo; He paused, as though his remark demanded a response.</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to be eighteen again,&rsquo; said Paul lamely.</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy, Doctor. He isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call real bright. Like his old man &ndash; his heart&rsquo;s in the right place, and he wants to do the most he can with what he&rsquo;s got.&rsquo; Again the waitful pause.</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all any of us can do,&rsquo; said Paul.</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;Well, as long as such a smart man as you is here, maybe I could get you to give me some advice for the boy. He just finished his National General Classification Tests, but he didn&rsquo;t do nearly well enough for college. There were only twenty-seven openings, and six hundred kids trying for them. I can&rsquo;t afford to send him to a private school, so now he&rsquo;s got to decide what he&rsquo;s going to do with his life, Doctor: what&rsquo;s it going to be, the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks<sup>1</sup>?&rsquo;</p>
                    <p>&lsquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for both,&rsquo; said Paul uncomfortably. &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know much about either one.&rsquo;</p>
